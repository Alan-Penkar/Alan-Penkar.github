![LeoPup]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/LeoPup.jpg){:class="inpage_left"} Meet Leopold.  At this time of this photo, Leopold was our brand new 12 week old [Great Pyrenees](http://www.greatpyratlanta.com/) ball of fluff.
 Sad eyed and bushy tailed, Leo had everything to learn about the world around himâ€” an adorable little learning agent!

At the time of this writing Leopold is 19 weeks old and has mastered his own bladder, bowels, and basic commands (when he chooses).
